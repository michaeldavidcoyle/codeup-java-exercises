    * Create four separate methods. Each will perform an arithmetic operation:
    * Addition
    * Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division
    * Each function needs to take two parameters/arguments so that the operation can be performed.
    * Test your methods and verify the output.
    * Add a modulus method that finds the modulus of two numbers.
    * Food for thought: What happens if we try to divide by zero? What should happen?
